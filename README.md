# Message Board 

This app has been generated using `create-react-app`, then cleaned up a little so we have a project with just the elements we need to get started.

This is a “single page application” with a public message board app with the following features:  

- A client can create an account and login 
- A client can create a new public message thread  
- A client can add a public reply to a message thread  
- A client can modify their own messages  
- A client can delete their own messages  
- Public message threads and replies are viewable
